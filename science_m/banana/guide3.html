  <h1>Learning Objective</h1>
  <p>Observe the fruit-making magic God designed.</p>

  <section>
      <h3>1. For Preschoolers</h3>

    <p>Food does not just get born in the store.</p>
    <p>God prepared a magical mechanism so that bananas grow on trees.</p>
    <p>From nothing, a tiny fruit appears and slowly grows.</p>
    <p>Each child has the chance to watch this process with their own eyes.</p>

    <h3>2. For Elementary School Children</h3>
    <p>Why is it that bananas don’t grow in Massachusetts, yet here, banana trees bear fruit so abundantly on their own?</p>

    <h3>3. For Middle School Students</h3>
    <p>Banana fruits are green at first. Why do they turn yellow as they mature?</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Advanced Study</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Why does the sweetness of a banana increase after it is harvested and left to sit?</li>
      <li>No sugar is injected after harvest, so why does the banana become sweeter on its own?</li>
      <li>What is the most appropriate time to harvest bananas?</li>
      <li>Bananas from the Philippines are harvested while still green and shipped by boat for import. Should bananas here also be harvested while still green?</li>
	    </ul>
  
	      <h3> For Graduate School Level </h3>
    <ul>

      <li>No high-tech laboratory can replicate the miraculous sugar synthesis method by which bananas become sweeter just by being left alone.</li>
      <li>Witness this wondrous magic prepared by God.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>


  <section>
    <h3>For Adults</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Is eating a banana right after it turns yellow the best way to enjoy it?</li>
      <li>Why doesn’t the banana tree make the fruit sweet from the beginning?</li>
      <li>What are the raw materials that create the sweetness in bananas?</li>
    </ul>
